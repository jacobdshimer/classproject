# The Grocery Frugal's Class Project

This repository will hold The Grocery Frugal team's class project code.  The Grocery Frugal is both the name of the team and the
name of the application that we are developing.  This program will help the user identify what it is they need to buy in order to 
make the recipe of their choosing.  It will also be a way for the user to track their favorite recipes.
